This game takes keyboard input from the arrow keys to move the dot/ball around the world. The goal of the game is to use the white ball to get all the green dots in the world while avoiding all the red dots. 
As you pass through the stages the games get harder with these modifications.
  - Green dots decrease by one and get smaller in size 
  - Red dots increase by one and get larger in size
